# multi-node-project

An example of using pallet in a multi-node project.

## Usage

- [An example clojure App](simple-app/README.md)
- [An example pallet deployer](deployer/README.md)

The example app just creates a simple application that can be deployed.

The example deployer provides an example of how to deploy to multiple
environments, on multiple VM providers.

This is a top-level project to contain the example.  It has no specific
functionality other than to provide a single git repository containing the
example project repositories.  It is not necessary to use a top-level project
like this for your own projects.
